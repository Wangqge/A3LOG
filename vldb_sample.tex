% ****************** AUTHORS **************************************

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
%Asynchronous recursive processing usually show better performance on convergence speed and resource utilization in many field. However The usage of Asynchronous processing usually be restricted to a small field because of the non-guaranteed correctness and unstable performance. The programming complexity also plagued the user. To address these problem ,we propose a series of conditions on correctly asynchronize an algorithm based on accumulate recursive aggregation and A3Log, an automated Asynchronous Graph computing system with a asynchronous condition checker embedded, which can  automatically check the whether  user's sequential program can be correctly executed using asynchronous Model.Besides,System provide a simple and convenient datalog interface.Both shared-memory runtime engine and distributed runtime engine. 

Aggregation means a data fusion operation which frequently used in Graph computing, machine learning and database query. Many recursive algorithm can be abstracted as a series of aggregate and non-aggregate operations(recursive aggregation). Asynchronous aggregation was proposed to accelerate the aggregation the and avoid the coordination. But the non-guaranteed correctness limit the usage. Moreover it is hard to write asynchronous program or check whether an algorithm can be correctly asynchronized. To address there problem 1)we propose a series of correctness conditions based on \textbf{accumulate recursive aggregation}. 2)We further proposed a convert method for some unsatisfied algorithm. 3)We implement a Datalog System with asynchronous condition checker embedded. User's sequential program will be checked and convert to asynchronous aggregation automatically. System provide both shared-memory and distributed runtime engine. Experiment shows that our System shows comparable and most time even better performance with other system, and asynchronous execution can achieve 2.25X-222.82X speedup over the synchronous version for various datasets.
