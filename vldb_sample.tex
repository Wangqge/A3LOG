% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
%Asynchronous recursive processing usually show better performance on convergence speed and resource utilization in many field. However The usage of Asynchronous processing usually be restricted to a small field because of the non-guaranteed correctness and unstable performance. The programming complexity also plagued the user. To address these problem ,we propose a series of conditions on correctly asynchronize an algorithm based on accumulate recursive aggregation and A3Log, an automated Asynchronous Graph computing system with a asynchronous condition checker embedded, which can  automatically check the whether  user's sequential program can be correctly executed using asynchronous Model.Besides,System provide a simple and convenient datalog interface.Both shared-memory runtime engine and distributed runtime engine. 

Asynchronous processing is a promising approach for accelerating parallel computations. It can avoid the expensive synchronization cost and improve resource utilization. Though asynchronous processing is not always the best execution model, it shows significant performance improvement for a large class of recursive programs. However in practice, the non-guaranteed correctness and the more complexity resulted from asynchronous processing restrict its use. In this paper, we first propose a series of sufficient conditions that guarantee the correctness of asynchronous recursive programs. We also show that some programs that do not originally satisfy the conditions can be converted to a new recursion form, so it can return the correct result with asynchronous execution. We then propose to automate the condition verification and automate the conversion by using SMT solver. We further design and implement a Datalog system A3Log. User's datalog program can be automatically checked or automatically converted for asynchronous parallel processing. A3Log provides both shared-memory runtime engine and distributed runtime engine. Experiment shows that A3Log exhibits better performance than existing parallel computation frameworks for a large class of applications.
