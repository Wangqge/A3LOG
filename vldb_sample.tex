% ****************** AUTHORS **************************************

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
Iterative data processing can be executed either in a synchronous mode (sync.) or in an asynchronous mode (async.). Sync. mode requires that messages from one iteration are only accessible in the next one, which is guaranteed by a global synchronization barrier. Async. mode eliminates the barrier in order to avoid the expensive synchronization cost, and maximizes the degree of parallelism. However, async. mode suffers from three drawbacks that restrict its usage in practice, namely (1) non-guaranteed correctness in convergence, (2) increased complexity in algorithms design, and (3) unstable performance in execution.
We have made the following efforts to turn async. iterative processing into a reality. Considering that the root reason of sync. mode is the aggregate operation, we analyze the properties aggregate/non-aggregate operations and provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the correctness of async. iterations. We then propose to automate the condition verification by using the SMT solver, which greatly lower the burden of programmers. We also propose a dynamic buffer mechanism that can adaptively adjust the degree between sync. and async. modes to maximize the performance. Putting all the above mentioned new research results, we have designed and implemented A3Log, a Datalog system on both shared memory and distributed memory platforms. Our intensive experiments show that A3Log outperforms the other state-of-the-art datalog systems including Socialite, Myria, and BigDatalog, say X-X speedup.
