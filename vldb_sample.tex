% ****************** AUTHORS **************************************

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
Data mining algorithms usually require iterative computations on input data. This has led to synchronous (\emph{sync.}) and asynchronous (\emph{async.}) iteration modes. Sync. mode forces computation to execute sequentially, which works against the goal of parallelism. On the contrary, async. iteration is a promising approach in parallel execution environment, since it avoids the expensive synchronization cost and improves resource utilization. However, async. suffers from three drawbacks that restrict its usage: 1) non-guaranteed correctness, async. mode does not always converge to the same result as sync. mode; 2) more complexity, async. code is a lot harder to write, tune, and debug; 3) unstable performance, async. mode does not consistently outperform sync. mode. In this paper, we argue that the root reason of Sync. is aggregate operation, so we analyze the properties of aggregate/non-aggregate operations and provide the sufficient conditions that guarantee the correctness of async. iteration. We then propose to automate the condition verification by using SMT solver, which greatly reduce the burden of programmers. We further propose a dynamic buffer mechanism that can adaptively tune the degree between async. and sync. for optimal performance. We design and implement a Datalog system \emph{A3Log} to combine all of the above techniques together. A3Log provides both shared-memory runtime engine and distributed runtime engine. On a high performance machine and a XX-node-cluster, A3Log outperforms the other state-of-the-art datalog systems including Socialite, Myria, and BigDatalog, say X-X speedup.
